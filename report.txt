Benchmark results of enwik8-ascii.txt

trie: 0m58.059s
shipped(hash+sort): 0m6.517s

My trie is ~10x slower than shipped implementations (in C).

TODO: implement trie in C and try re-benchmark

Ps:
how to extract ascii words from enwik8
grep -o "[a-zA-Z]*" enwik8 | grep -Pv "[\x80-\xFF]" > enwik8-ascii.txt
